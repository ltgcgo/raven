# Raven Hangul
## Design
### Goals
1. As fast as possible for most users.
2. Try to be intuitive to non-native users, to reduce learning cost as much as possible.

### Principles
1. Reduce the keys required overall.
2. Match the vowels with their frequency.
3. Provide dedicated keys for common composite trailing consonants.

## Keymap
The `×` keys either indicate blank input or act as stream breakers.

### First stage
Keys are positioned to try reflecting their mapped Hangul's pronunciation.
